# Hackers-Loft
My custom blog utilizing Remnote, Tome, and Chirpy Jekyll Theme

# Issue we came across
The name of the repository has to be in a very specific format as if it is not in the format the files required to deploy the website will be missing the repo naming syntax goes as follows:

GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io

# How does this work?

This exports your Remnote as a .md with the correct categories to show up on the website.
This also imports a tome.app pdf into the website.

Doing this normally would be a fairly complicated setup especially with the generative aspect to some of the literature.

# Todo
Create scripts & update theme and favicon add gussian blur aswell as programming background. Give a red and black theme
